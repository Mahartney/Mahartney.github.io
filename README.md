Project 1: FlashCards

I chose flashcards because I thought I had a clear view of an attainable MVP.
However, I think I overextended myself and am not particularly satisfied with the way it turned out.
In fact, I did not see the actual instructions for the assigned MVP for flashcards until tuesday night.
I did not approach flashcards as game but as an education tool.
Therefore my game does not keep score or attempt to keep score.
Nor does it re-display incorrect answers as it doesn't track correct vs incorrect responses.
Also, I attempted a couple things that were not assigned as bonuses but took up a lot of time.
Firstly, I attemped a save/load feature with modest success.
If every file is separate I think it does okay, it does not do well saving over files.
Second, I included an element to suggest answer.
This function lists out the corect answer and three random incorrect answers in random order.

I used html, jquery and css to accomplish this.




As a user I want to be able to create a question/answer pair flashcard
As a user I want to be able to submit/hide a paired flashcard in a deck
As a user I want to be able to "deal" the deck showing one questions one at a time
As a user I want to be able to show "hints", seeing the correct answer and 3 other random incorrect answers
As a user I want to be able to select and answer and deal the next flashcard
